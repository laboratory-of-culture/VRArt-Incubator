## Token of Tripyllya

In the Chernivtsi Regional Museum of Local Lore, Nikita Khudyakov chose an ancient ax tip, which is over 6,000 years old, and combined it with a Trypillia painting.

Transferring this idea to augmented reality (AR), he created the first NFT-token in Chernivtsi (NFT-token is a unique personal code of a work of digital art that helps to consolidate the authorship of the work). “Inspired by the shape and patterns of this object and other ancient objects of Trypillia culture. I created a digital token, a three-dimensional object that rotates. During the experiments with Trypillia patterns, he developed own technique of combining geometric shapes, ”- Nikita Khudyakov, digital artist.

>By digging into the history of this region I started to investigate images and patterns of Trypillia. During experimentation with these patterns and painting the 3D object I developed a technique of painting individual polygons. Previously I used it in simpler forms but now I’ve decided to proceed with this practice and give it the name of Polygon art.
